# Shortly

This project is part of Frontend Mentor's catalogue of project ideas.  

The goal was to (based only on a few images) do a Landing page with a URL shortener and responsive design.

## Run It Locally
>[!NOTE]
This is assuming you have both Node.js and git installed, if not, do it before start.
  
first clone this repo in your terminal

```
git clone https://github.com/TomasPereira-Dev/frontendMentor-Challenge14.git
```

Then change the folder you are into with

```
cd ./frontendMentor-Challenge14
```

Once you are there, Install everything with 

```
npm install
```

And run it.
```
npm run dev
```

## Tech I Used
I mainly used React, JavaScript and Tailwind for the styling, for the URL shortener I used   
the Rebrandly REST API

## Caveats
The free plan of Rebrandly only allows short 25 links per month, so depending if people used it or not  
it might not work as it should.
